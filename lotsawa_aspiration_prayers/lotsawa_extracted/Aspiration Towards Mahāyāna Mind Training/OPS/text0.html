    <h2>An Aspiration Towards the Mahāyāna Mind Training</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em>by Ga Rabjampa Kunga Yeshe</em>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Homage to the guru!</em>
    </p>
    <p>Always loving towards beings and never untimely,<br />
Victorious buddhas and your heirs—think of me, I pray!<br />
Grant your blessings, so that these, my heartfelt aspirations<br />
To train and follow in your footsteps, may come true! </p>
    <p>With compassion for all beings, limitless in number,<br />
And devotion born of faith and understanding,<br />
May I take refuge, from now until enlightenment,<br />
With trust in the teacher and the Three Jewels! </p>
    <p>This human form, so difficult to find, will not last long,<br />
No matter where I’m reborn, there’ll be no chance of happiness,<br />
And positive and negative actions bear their fruits unfailingly—<br />
Seeing this, may I devote myself wholeheartedly to the sacred Dharma! </p>
    <p>As it is a medicine to soothe all the pains of saṃsāric existence,<br />
A supreme treasure bringing benefit and happiness to all,<br />
And a gentle mother nurturing the buddhas and their heirs,<br />
May my confidence in bodhicitta remain forever steadfast! </p>
    <p>Never proud, no matter how prosperous I become,<br />
And never despondent, even in dire misfortune,<br />
This vast strength of mind possessed by bodhisattvas—<br />
May it take birth definitively in my heart! </p>
    <p>As it is the very essence of all the teachings,<br />
The single path followed by all of Buddha’s heirs,<br />
And the guide and teacher to all who are enlightened:<br />
May bodhicitta arise swiftly in my own mind! </p>
    <p>These dream-like phenomena, delusory perceptions of my mind,<br />
Are unborn and beyond all conceptual elaboration.<br />
Seeing this, during the post-meditation, through illusion-like concentration,<br />
May I benefit these beings, figments of my own delusion, on a vast scale! </p>
    <p>When seeing my companions, so kind and helpful to me in the past,<br />
Sinking now in this vast ocean of suffering,<br />
May my mind be filled with love and tenderness for all,<br />
Like a mother watching helplessly as her beloved child is swept away and drowned! </p>
    <p>May I take upon myself the harms and sufferings of beings,<br />
My own mothers and fathers from lives without beginning,<br />
And may I give away my own happiness and virtue to others,<br />
So that this noble attitude, taught to be supreme, is ignited in my mind! </p>
    <p>May whatever appears, the basis of afflictions like ignorance, desire and anger,<br />
Whether it be friendly, hostile or neutral,<br />
Become a support for bodhicitta,<br />
Like fuel heaped upon a blazing fire! </p>
    <p>As it is the cause of all the afflictions that bind us in saṃsāra,<br />
The source of negative karma and the various forms of suffering,<br />
And a demon that obstructs us on the path to enlightenment:<br />
May I firmly uproot all forms of self-cherishing! </p>
    <p>Like perceiving nectar as pus, as a result of karma,<br />
The faults I see in others reflect my own impure perception.<br />
Knowing this, may I be respectful to all other beings,<br />
Sources of ocean-like qualities of happiness and positivity! </p>
    <p>Suffering, disdain, slander, and the like,<br />
Whatever unwanted circumstances befall me,<br />
By seeing them as a support for the bodhisattva training,<br />
May I accept them all with a mind of perfect joy! </p>
    <p>The bounties of this world are like the stuff of dreams—<br />
However many I acquire, may I never be attached to them,<br />
And, while seeing them as a means of benefitting others,<br />
May I not be afraid to sacrifice even life and limb! </p>
    <p>Should even my oldest and dearest of friends<br />
Turn against me and regard me as an enemy,<br />
May I respond only with love and strive to bring about<br />
Their benefit and happiness, now and in the future! </p>
    <p>Should hordes of demons craving flesh and blood<br />
Descend upon me, intent on devouring this illusory body,<br />
Still may I not succumb to thoughts of self-cherishing,<br />
But, with love, strive to bring them only benefit! </p>
    <p>Seeing that these various phenomena do not ever part<br />
From mind’s nature, which is, and always has been, peaceful,<br />
May deluded perceptions of adversity, like the moon’s reflection,<br />
Lead me to a clear realization of the actual nature of reality! </p>
    <p>Seeing all harm-doers as spiritual friends,<br />
All suffering as adornments for the mind,<br />
And all adversity as incitement to virtue,<br />
May unfavorable circumstances be transformed into the path! </p>
    <p>Knowing that hankering after my own happiness is the true enemy,<br />
May ordinary adversaries become supports for awakening!<br />
And, seeing sickness as a means of purifying negativity,<br />
May unfavorable circumstances be transformed into the path! </p>
    <p>Seeing evil omens as circumstances for attracting prosperity,<br />
Evil spirits as supports for gaining accomplishment,<br />
And evil companions as a way of deepening my understanding of mistaken practice,<br />
May adverse circumstances be transformed into the path! </p>
    <p>Knowing what to take up and avoid, I shall accumulate and purify correctly,<br />
Pleasing the guardians will bring victory over obstacles and māras,<br />
And through skill in means, all types of hindrance will become supports—<br />
May I take to heart the four kinds of practice! </p>
    <p>With sheer delight, may I don the armor of commitment<a class="footnote" href="#fn__1" id="fnref__1" title="see footnote">[1]</a><br />
And train the mind in the Dharma that subdues self-clinging!<br />
With the support of wholesome methods and aspirations,<br />
May my practice of Dharma equal the length of my life! </p>
    <p>With the devotion of constantly recalling the guru,<br />
And perfect familiarity with bodhicitta, absolute and relative,<br />
While never straying from the Dharma that is profound and vast,<br />
May I have the merit to face death in this way! </p>
    <p>Even though I be assailed by humans and non-human demons,<br />
Tormented by a disturbance in the body’s elements,<br />
Or afflicted by intense destructive emotions,<br />
May supreme bodhicitta never diminish! </p>
    <p>Even as the bardos’s horrors unfold within my deluded perception,<br />
Or as I enter a future mother’s womb, or later, during other lifetimes,<br />
May I never forget, even for so much as a single instant,<br />
The essence of Dharma—bodhicitta, precious and sublime! </p>
    <p>The victorious buddhas and their heirs, the spiritual friends,<br />
Proclaim this excellent, genuine path to their circles of disciples.<br />
Serving such teachers throughout all my lives to come,<br />
And embracing this instruction, may I benefit others! </p>
    <p>By subduing self-clinging, may whatever I do become the Dharma!<br />
Banishing hope and fear, may whatever happens be supportive!<br />
By mastering the altruistic attitude, even if I should suffer,<br />
May it only contribute to others’ happiness and joy! </p>
    <p>Never contaminated by the poison of clinging to beliefs<br />
Nor bound by compassion that is limited and partial,<br />
May precious bodhicitta, uniting relative and absolute,<br />
Dispel all the ills of both existence and quiescence! </p>
    <p>Even if my actions of body and speech are ordinary,<br />
May I never be separated from the mind of bodhicitta!<br />
Even without a routine of contrived virtuous actions,<br />
Through motivation’s power, may I gather merit in abundance! </p>
    <p>Though I dedicate my body, life, possessions and merits of past, present and future,<br />
Each and every day for the good of all who live,<br />
May hopes of gaining some benefit or happiness for myself in return<br />
Never occur to me, even for an instant! </p>
    <p>To take defeat upon myself and give the victory to others,<br />
To keep the lowest place and respect each and every being,<br />
To offer only benefit in response to any harm that’s done:<br />
This is the discipline of the bodhisattvas—may I embrace it! </p>
    <p>Respecting the teachers and taking to heart all that they say,<br />
Bringing together all the teachings in a single practice,<br />
And abandoning hope and fear, may I always, for the sake of others,<br />
Clothe myself in the armor of enthusiastic diligence! </p>
    <p>If it should prove to be a cause of harm to others,<br />
May I abandon like chaff<a class="footnote" href="#fn__2" id="fnref__2" title="see footnote">[2]</a> even the bliss of liberation!<br />
If it should benefit others, may I be born in the lower realms,<br />
Entering happily, as if strolling into a pleasant garden! </p>
    <p>Guarding the three trainings as though they were my very eyes,<br />
May my body, speech and mind never waver from the Dharma,<br />
And may I dedicate all my merits of the past, present, and future,<br />
Purely, free from the three concepts of subject, object, and action! </p>
    <p>With a mind filled with joy, may I enter<br />
The ocean of conduct, vast and limitless in depth,<br />
The mine of many million jewels of virtue and goodness,<br />
And the source of powerful accumulation!<a class="footnote" href="#fn__3" id="fnref__3" title="see footnote">[3]</a> </p>
    <p>When oppressed by the burden of all manner of sufferings,<br />
Through this particular remedy, out of all the countless skilful methods,<br />
May I bring benefit and happiness to all beings without exception,<br />
And gain great powers of samādhi meditation! </p>
    <p>Enlightened vision and actions are like a vast ocean, impossible to fathom;<br />
So, having gathered within the great lake-like vessel of my own mind<br />
Rivers of treasure-like qualities drawn from an infinite sea of victorious buddhas,<br />
May my own actions be indistinguishable from the ocean of enlightened activity! </p>
    <p>
      <em>This prayer, incorporating the uncommon terminology of the Mahāyāna mind-training teachings in verses of aspiration, was composed by the one who has a heartfelt trust in this teaching, Lodrö Shenpen Dawa.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__4" id="fnref__4" title="see footnote">[4]</a> May it be virtuous and auspicious!</em>
