    <p>In the language of India: <em>Bodhyākara­praṇidhāna</em><br />

In the English language: <em>Aspiration That Is a Source of Awakening</em> </p>
    <p>
      <em>Homage to the youthful Māñjuśrī!</em>
    </p>
    <p>I pay homage to the buddhas, the transcendent conquerors,<br />
Who have dispelled the darkness of wrong views and whose wisdom is fully bloomed,<br />
Who have conquered the four māras and proceeded in accord with genuine reality,<br />
Those oceans of compassion and treasuries rich with supreme purpose. </p>
    <p>I pay homage to the perfect Dharma teachings,<br />
Space-like—without characteristics, utterly peaceful, beyond conceptualization,<br />
Free from the faults of obscurations, a source of excellence in abundance,<br />
And the wellspring of awakening for many wandering beings. </p>
    <p>I pay homage to the noble Saṅgha communities,<br />
Who have conquered the enemy of afflictions and crossed the ocean of conditioned existence,<br />
Who have abandoned the armaments of sorrow and know the path to perfect liberation,<br />
Who benefit beings and are well supplied with the very finest attributes. </p>
    <p>I pay homage to the assembly of bodhisattvas,<br />
For whom the sun of wisdom has risen in the sky of dharmadhātu,<br />
Dispelling the darkness of ignorance and realizing the true nature of reality,<br />
And who, endowed with skilful means and compassion, strive to benefit beings. </p>
    <p>I offer to the Victors and their heirs, who possess treasure-like qualities:<br />
The precious ground with forests of wish-fulfilling trees,<br />
Celestial palaces with thrones adorned with supreme ornaments,<br />
And vast billowing clouds of offerings from gods and humans. </p>
    <p>All the times when I have abandoned the Three Jewels,<br />
Or turned away from the mind of awakening,<br />
Or committed boundless crimes and other negative deeds,<br />
I confess before my teachers; never again shall I commit such acts. </p>
    <p>I rejoice in all the meritorious deeds,<br />
Both the causes and their results,<br />
Of buddhas, <em>pratyekabuddhas</em>, <em>śrāvakas</em>,<br />
Bodhisattvas, and ordinary beings. </p>
    <p>I implore those sugatas who intend to pass into parinirvāṇa:<br />
For the benefit of beings in any direction,<br />
Please remain without passing into nirvāṇa<br />
And turn the sublime wheel of Dharma for beings’ sake. </p>
    <p>I offer my body at all times to the precious Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha,<br />
Who are purified of all faults and perfect in all qualities.<br />
I take refuge in them. Please accept me completely<br />
And protect me, I pray, from the path of mistaken views. </p>
    <p>In order to dispel the afflictions of beings<br />
And to continue the line of the conquerors with <em>bodhi</em> activity,<br />
I shall set my sights on supreme, unsurpassable awakening—<br />
Selfless, free from concepts, non-abiding, and everlasting. </p>
    <p>Victorious Ones and your heirs throughout space and time, pay heed!<br />
From this day forward, I pledge to uphold the threefold training,<br />
With the discipline of refraining from harmful actions,<br />
Gathering virtuous dharmas, and benefiting sentient beings. </p>
    <p>By the power of this merit, may abundant clouds of offerings<br />
Arise for all abodes of the Dharma.<br />
May all sentient beings purify theirs multitudes of obscurations<br />
And perfect the accumulation of qualities to become supremely omniscient. </p>
    <p>At all times, may I possess a mind that is compassionate.<br />
Having attained supreme concentration, wisdom, and the gates of <em>dhāraṇī</em>,<br />
May I perform supreme actions that bring happiness to all beings<br />
And realise all phenomena exactly as they are. </p>
    <p>May I attract others through the four means of attraction, perfect the pāramitās,<br />
Train thoroughly in all stages beginning with that of devoted conduct,<br />
Avoid the accumulation of afflictive and cognitive obscurations,<br />
And perfect the accumulations of merit and wisdom to become a Buddha. </p>
    <p>By merely seeing, hearing, touching, or remembering me,<br />
May all beings allay their afflictions and sorrows.<br />
No matter what I do in the physical, vocal, or mental spheres,<br />
May it become a cause for the happiness of all living beings. </p>
    <p>Whatever minor sources of virtue I might accumulate<br />
With body, speech, and mind throughout the whole of time,<br />
I dedicate them all, in the manner of the Victors of the three times,<br />
Toward the swift and unsurpassable awakening of all. </p>
