    <h1>Aspiration on the Occasion of Bestowing the Name Orgyen Tekchok Ngesang Tupten Pelgye Ling on the New Temple at Takmo Monastery</h1>

    </p>
    <p>Namo guru!<br />
Through the blessings of the great compassion and truth<br />
Of the Three Roots and Three Jewels together with the guardians,<br />
And especially the master of Oḍḍiyāna, Dorje Drolö,<br />
May auspiciousness forever increase here in this place. </p>
    <p>May the teachings of the essence of the supreme vehicle long endure,<br />
May the victory banner of the definitively secret vajra pinnacle be raised,<br />
And may this sanctuary for advancing the Sage’s teachings through study and through practice<br />
Flourish everywhere and evermore. </p>
    <p>Through the force of this, may any decline in the environment or among living beings be pacified,<br />
May there be joy and happiness in every land and location,<br />
May all living beings come to possess benevolence,<br />
And may the splendour of the ten virtues endure long into the future. </p>
    <p>
      <em>These verses of aspiration were written by Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö, who holds the name of a Khyentse incarnation, on the occasion of bestowing the name Orgyen Tekchok Ngesang Tupten Pelgye Ling on the new temple at Takmo Monastery in response to a request from Ngülra Lama Lodrö, who, with positive intentions, laid the temple’s foundation. May this prove virtuous and auspicious!</em>
