    <h1>The Invocation of Uḍḍiyāna<a class="footnote" href="#fn__1" id="fnref__1" title="see footnote">[1]</a> on the Tenth Day</h1>
    <p>
      <em>revealed by Ratna Lingpa</em>
    </p>
    <p>I, the Lotus-Born, made these prayers,<br />
Filled with goodness for the benefit of all:<br />
Tertöns will emerge in the times to come,<br />
Each to enjoy treasures deep and profound. </p>
    <p>A great tertön there shall be for every great land,<br />
And a minor tertön for every little one.<br />
In brief, the ways I tame are beyond imagination,<br />
For Uḍḍiyāna’s kindness is not slight, but vast! </p>
    <p>Every realm shall have a most sacred place,<br />
That will be a monument to Uḍḍiyāna;<br />
At every frontier there will be a treasure trove,<br />
Likewise a monument to Uḍḍiyāna; </p>
    <p>Every ordained monk each with a lineage<br />
Shall be a monument to Uḍḍiyāna.<br />
In every land and every city a <em>mantrin</em> –<br />
They too will be monuments to Uḍḍiyāna. </p>
    <p>All practices for binding demons under oath –<br />
These are monuments to Uḍḍiyāna.<br />
All methods for subjugating all eight kinds of demons<br />
Will also be monuments to Uḍḍiyāna. </p>
    <p>Every way to avert black magic and spells<br />
Will be a monument to Uḍḍiyāna.<br />
And every tenth day of every month –<br />
This too will be a monument to Uḍḍiyāna. </p>
    <p>In sum, all the infinite ways to tame beings<br />
Shall be my monuments—monuments to Uḍḍiyāna.<br />
When people yearn for me in times to come,<br />
Behold, I will be there, standing by their side. </p>
    <p>When the tenth day of the month comes,<br />
Those who uphold these monuments of mine<br />
Shall be inseparable from me. </p>
    <p>Every community with faith in the Dharma,<br />
I will care for you.<br />
Every town and every household<br />
That acts out of virtue with faith in the Dharma,<br />
I will care for you.<br />
Amidst the pleasures and pains
of eating and drinking, going to and fro,<br />
Remember me but for an instant,<br />
And at that very moment I will bless you—of that, be sure.<br />
Whoever yearns for me out of trust,<br />
Know that we have been connected<br />
For eons upon eons beyond beginning.<br />
In time you will be born again in my realm.<br />
The Lotus-Born does not speak false words. </p>
    <p>So fill your minds with joy, those with faith,<br />
My followers in generations to come,<br />
And practice the tenth day offering as follows:<br />
Place a large <em>bali</em> mixed with spices,<br />
Encircled by eight colorful lotus petals,<br />
Upon a fine maṇḍala platform.<br />
Garnish the bali all around with garlic and onions, meat and butter,<br />
And encircle the whole with precious objects,<br />
With butter lamps, ritual cakes, water offerings and incense.<br />
It is also highly auspicious to perform a fire offering<br />
Of three whites, three sweets, an abundance of jewels,<br />
Of foods, drinks and various powders—<br />
All that is in harmony with the maṇḍala you practice.<br />
Chant the <em>Seven-Line Prayer</em> in your clearest voice<br />
To the sound of drum and conch and cymbal.<br />
As directed in the eighth chapter of the activity manual,<br />
“Generally, proceed according to one’s own tradition.”<a class="footnote" href="#fn__2" id="fnref__2" title="see footnote">[2]</a><br />
With substances like meat, rice, garlic and onion,<br />
Go beyond all concepts of pure and impure,<br />
And practice a bountiful gaṇacakra! </p>
    <p>With body, perform ritual dances and assume the postures,<br />
And the experience of bliss shall blaze forth.<br />
With voice, sing dharma songs and contemplative tunes,<br />
And your secret speech will grow in power.<br />
With mind, cultivate samādhi without concepts,<br />
And the experience of realization beyond words will dawn.<br />
Pray until you are stirred to tears,<br />
And let a flowing river of blessings<br />
Wash over you, and through you.<br />
When these experiences are all ablaze,<br />
The blessings have arrived,<br />
A sign that I am there in person.<br />
Have no doubt that I have truly come. </p>
    <p>After I have travelled to the land of rakṣasas,<br />
On the tenth day of every month I will return.<br />
For my children, my disciples, the mantrins of Tibet,<br />
I will come back personally—this is a promise.<br />
The Lotus-Born does not deceive other beings,<br />
So be rid of your doubts, my followers.<br />
Make your minds suitable, and every tenth day<br />
Do as follows, child: make effort and pray,<br />
Certain in your wish to cast off saṃsāra.<br />
Entrust me with your mind, your heart, your very core! </p>
    <p>People of later generations who trust in me,<br />
Disciples connected by their aspirations,<br />
Should clear away any doubts, and be firm in their belief<br />
According to these instructions so clearly written.<br />
In truth, for me there is no traveling and no remaining.<br />
Although I am beyond both coming and going,<br />
Even so, conventionally speaking,<br />
Within the dualistic experience of habitual thought,<br />
I reside in the celestial realms.<br />
Yet due to these habits swirling about the body’s enclosure,<br />
And due to the two veils remaining unpurified,<br />
None of you now can see my face.<br />
But when the veils of your afflictions are totally cleansed,<br />
You will look upon me, Padma, in person,<br />
And then there will be the chance to converse.<br />
Once you are a yogin well on the path,<br />
We will meet in your meditative experiences and dreams.<br />
In reality, though, whoever lets virtue arise in their mind,<br />
Or whenever immeasurable compassion wells up,<br />
Or when, for a split second, you remember me,<br />
That too will be our meeting.<br />
For those who have a mind filled with faith,<br />
My stream of compassion flows unceasingly.<br />
Ultimately, though I am beyond going or coming.<br />
When your karma and veils are both washed clean,<br />
That is the moment when we meet.<br />
According to the aspirations and relative perceptions<br />
Of those beings capable of training,<br />
I am indeed residing in the land of rakṣasas.<br />
And yet, because the stream of my compassion is unbroken,<br />
There I am, beside all those with faith in me. </p>
    <p>Now, I shall not explain much more,<br />
Because words are but a rotten corpse.<br />
In the end, just lay the weight of your heart and mind on me.<br />
Whether your rank is high or low,<br />
Harbor no doubts: my blessings will come<br />
In step with your devotion.<br />
On what should you rely for reaching accomplishment?<br />
The invocation of Uḍḍiyāna on the tenth day!<br />
In short, those with diligence, faith, and intelligence,<br />
Will be embraced by my compassion, just as I have said.<br />
May those with the karma practice just so! </p>
    <p>Emaho!<a class="footnote" href="#fn__3" id="fnref__3" title="see footnote">[3]</a><br />
Child of noble family, enjoy this profound treasure!<br />
In the final fifty years of the degenerate age,<br />
When demon murderers are on the rampage,<br />
With swords unyielding,<br />
Laying waste the holy places, plundering the sites—<br />
Such are the times when this instruction will be revealed.<br />
Iron element in opposition, conduct unattached—<br />
Such are the signs of your noble birth.<br />
You will be adorned in the crook of your right thigh<br />
By a mole both white and black.<br />
Below your navel will be a mark, like the eye of a ḍākinī.<br />
Your shoulder will bear a mole, marked like the eye of a ḍākinī.<br />
To the right of the hair that grows between his eyebrows<br />
Will be a mark, a mole like a fish’s eye.<br />
Your right flank will be marked by signs of the five ḍākinīs.<br />
May all those with the karma meet you! </p>
    <p>To the northeast of his treasure trove will be a marketplace<br />
Where people from north and south gather together.<br />
There, three authentic women,<br />
Excellent in character, aged from thirteen to forty-five,<br />
Will rely upon this yogin’s skillful means.<br />
And after they rely upon you,<br />
These ones with excellent character, they who have so relied,<br />
Will take hold of ultimate awareness—have no doubt of that! </p>
    <p>If a shrine to the three kāyas is built at that marketplace,<br />
The southern border will be an area especially auspicious and blessed.<br />
Of that, harbor no doubt at all, my followers.<br />
And if you leave a yellow scroll at that place<br />
The consecration will be truly auspicious. </p>
    <p>Samaya. Gya gya gya. Katham.</p>
