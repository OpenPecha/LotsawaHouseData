    <h1>Prayer Praising the Kāyas of Lord Pakmodrupa</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em>by Yelpa Yeshe Tsek</em>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p><em>Namo guru!</em><br />
You realized the <em>adamantine</em> meaning of mind itself being unborn<br />
And emerged <em>victorious</em> from battle with the afflictions and other foes.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__1" id="fnref__1" title="see footnote">[1]</a><br />
Working hard to help others, your enlightened mind filled with love—<br />
Guru whose sublime name is so meaningful, to you, I bow. </p>
    <p>Emerging from the sublime setting of dharmadhātu, beyond appearances,<br />
In your compassion, benefitting beings in every way,<br />
You appeared as the nirmāṇakāya whom I call my guru.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__2" id="fnref__2" title="see footnote">[2]</a><br />
With my body, speech, and mind filled with devotion, I bow my crown to your feet. </p>
    <p>In the true meaning of equalness, there is no fluctuation between<br />
Kaleidoscopic appearances and the mind’s ups and downs.<br />
Guru, you who rests forever in equipoise—<br />
Guru who is unchanging dharmakāya, to you, I bow. </p>
    <p>Community of accomplished masters,<br />
Maṇḍala of ḍākas and ḍākinīs, hosts of devas,<br />
Assembly of destined bodhisattvas—<br />
All like clouds continually massing over days and nights,<br />
And you who revel in the ongoing state of unified emptiness and compassion—<br />
Saṃbhogakāya guru, to you, I bow. </p>
    <p>My own mind dawns as the guru of recognizing pristine awareness.<br />
Kaleidoscopic appearances<a class="footnote" href="#fn__3" id="fnref__3" title="see footnote">[3]</a> dawn as the dharmakāya guru.<br />
The six classes of being dawn as nirmāṇakāya gurus.<br />
Illustrious triune guru,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__4" id="fnref__4" title="see footnote">[4]</a> to you, I bow. </p>
    <p>You teach how devotion to the guru is the root of accomplishment,<br />
How love and compassion are the root of the Great Vehicle,<br />
And how unaltered cognition is the root of direct guidance.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__5" id="fnref__5" title="see footnote">[5]</a><br />
Illustrious one expert in these three instructions, to you, I bow. </p>
    <p>Desire dawns as immaculate bliss.<br />
Hostility dawns as immaculate love.<br />
Benightedness dawns as immaculate luminosity.<br />
Illustrious master of these three samādhis, to you, I bow. </p>
    <p>The phenomenal world is attracted through the power of realization.<br />
Blessings are attracted through the power of devotion.<br />
The six classes of being are attracted through the power of compassion.<br />
Illustrious master of the three attracting powers, to you, I bow. </p>
    <p>Peerless, supreme protector of beings,<br />
Who establishes destined ones on the path to liberation<br />
Through the myriad interdependencies<a class="footnote" href="#fn__6" id="fnref__6" title="see footnote">[6]</a> of profound Secret Mantra—<br />
Guru who has mastered magnificent skillful means, to you, I bow. </p>
    <p>Guru, inspired and blessed by you,<br />
I have tried to express some small part of the ocean of your enlightened qualities.<br />
By this goodness, for all beings, may the sky of mind itself be perfectly purified;<br />
May the unchanging view come about spontaneously;<br />
May the flow of unwavering meditation never be broken;<br />
May the ways of our body and speech be cured of desire and hostility;<br />
And may the fruition of the three kāyas ripen within us. </p>
    <p>In all my lives, may I never part from the authentic guru;<br />
May I perfectly appreciate the Dharma’s splendor;<br />
May I consummate the qualities of the levels and paths of the bodhisattvas;<br />
And may I swiftly attain the state of Vajradhara! </p>
    <p>
