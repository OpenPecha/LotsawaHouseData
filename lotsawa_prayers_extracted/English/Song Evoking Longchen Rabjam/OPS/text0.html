    <h2>A Song Evoking the Omniscient King of Dharma</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em>by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö</em>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <p><em>At the feet of the Father Guru, I pay homage.</em> </p>
    <p>Within the self-manifest expanse of five-coloured rainbow light<br />
Abides the omniscient lord of speech, Ngakgi Wangpo—<br />
His form, radiant and resplendent with the signs and marks,<br />
His speech, ceaselessly proclaiming Dharma in Brahmā’s voice,<br />
And his mind never departing from meditative equipoise<br />
Within the vajra-like expanse of all-pervasive luminosity.<br />
Embodiment of the victors and their heirs throughout past, present and future,<br />
All-knowing protector, Dharma lord, I remember you in the depths of my heart. </p>
    <p>When the kingly eastern peak that towers over meadows and rocks<br />
Is transformed by the slow-moving dance of white clouds<br />
In the clear blue sky that extends towards the azure heavens,<br />
All-knowing lord, Dorje Ziji, I remember you. </p>
    <p>As I recall you and exert myself in prayer,<br />
My heart is pierced by the great stake of devotion,<br />
And I let out anguished sighs of unbearable longing.<br />
In my faith and ardour, the hairs of my body stand on end<br />
And tears fall from my eyes.<br />
All-knowing father, primordial protector,<br />
Reveal your smiling face, directly before my eyes! </p>
    <p>In your form of pristine wisdom, which is immaterial<br />
And ablaze as if with a billion rays of golden light,<br />
And with the sweet roar of profound, vast instruction,<br />
Waken me, here and now, from the slumber of ignorance. </p>
    <p>Let your heart’s spontaneously present sphere of five-coloured light<br />
Merge, here and now, into the centre of my own heart.<br />
Help me to see my true face, uncontrived and uncreated,<br />
The ground that is the three-kāya guru of indivisible awareness and emptiness.<br />
Let whatever I experience arise spontaneously<br />
As adornments to the wheel of pristine wisdom,<br />
And let my practice be enhanced through the activity<br />
In which the naturally arisen is naturally freed without grasping,<br />
So that the elaborate web of conditioned phenomena is absorbed<br />
Within the great dissolution into the ground of primordial purity.<br />
Then, as the array of kāyas and realms manifests out of basic space<br />
May I cause the six realms of saṃsāra to be emptied from the depths. </p>
    <p>As I give voice to these words with the sweetest melody,<br />
Lord and all-knowing guru, inspire me with your blessings.<br />
Your son, foolish old Lodrö, is tormented by evil karma<br />
And calls out to you in single-pointed devotion and prayer! </p>
    <p><em>Composed on the twenty-ninth day of the eighth month of the Wood Dog</em>.</p>
