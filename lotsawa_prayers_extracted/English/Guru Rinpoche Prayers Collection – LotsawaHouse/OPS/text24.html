    <h1>The Wish-Fulfilling Tree: The Life Story of the Master of Uḍḍiyāna</h1>
    <h2>As Found in Padmasambhava’s Sevenfold Cycle of Profundity</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>
        <em>revealed by Chokgyur Dechen Lingpa</em>
      </strong>
    </p>
    <h3>Chapter One</h3>
    <p><span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">ཐཾཊ།བྱ།རྩ།༔</span><br /><em>Emaho</em>. How marvelous!<br />
I, Padma, shall here present the story of my life—<br />
How I mastered the sacred Dharma, all three vehicles,<br />
How my deeds for beings became a constant flow,<br />
And how I have unceasingly spun the Wheel of Dharma. </p>
    <p>Each and every sentient being of the sixfold classes<br />
Strays incessantly through saṃsāra, confused, unknowing.<br />
Especially in the Age of Strife,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__1" id="fnref__1" title="see footnote">[1]</a> the dregs of time,<br />
Beings are steeped in the five poisons and act in errant ways.<br />
To inspire them, hard as they are to change,<br />
The dharmakāya buddhas directed their attention;<br />
The sambhogakaya buddhas asserted their command;<br />
And the nirmanakaya buddhas in conference all agreed<br />
That I, the Lotus Master, should appear in this world, Jambudvīpa. </p>
    <p>Perceived by some, I magically appeared in Uḍḍiyāna,<br />
Upon a lotus flower on the waters of Dhanakośa.<br />
Perceived by others, I was the son of Uḍḍiyāna’s king.<br />
Perceived by still others, I descended as a thunderbolt<br />
Onto the peak of Mount Meteoric Iron. </p>
    <p>In any case, it was twenty-four years after Śākyamuni’s passing<br />
That Amitābha took the form of a bodhisattva,<br />
The Great Compassionate One,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__2" id="fnref__2" title="see footnote">[2]</a> and from his heart<br />
He magically conjured me, Padma, as the letter <em>hrīḥ</em>. </p>
    <p>What’s more, I arrived in all the worlds like the rain,<br />
Descending upon countless millions of billions of places.<br />
Indeed, the deeds of the Conquerors surpass the reach of thought:<br />
Who could ever measure them or limit their scope? </p>
    <p>Nevertheless, conjured I was to Jambudvīpa,<br />
As the destined son of Uḍḍiyāna’s king.<br />
Over that kingdom I reigned, turning the Wheel of Mahāyāna Dharma,<br />
So that everyone would together realize true awakening.<br />
Then, I journeyed through the lands of India<br />
And learned to perfection the fivefold fields of knowledge.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__3" id="fnref__3" title="see footnote">[3]</a> </p>
    <p><em>This was the first chapter in Padma’s Wish-Fulfilling Tree, my story of liberation, on how I came into this world and trained in the fields of knowledge.</em> </p>
    <h3>Chapter Two</h3>
    <p><span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">ཐ་ཅ།ཐརྒྱ༔</span><br />
In India, I raised questions on the sūtras with Ānanda,<br />
Buddha Śākyamuni’s close disciple.<br />
In Prabhahasti’s presence I became a renunciant monk,<br />
And studied all the teachings of the triple yogas.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__4" id="fnref__4" title="see footnote">[4]</a> </p>
    <p>Then I went before the master Prahevajra<a class="footnote" href="#fn__5" id="fnref__5" title="see footnote">[5]</a><br />
And requested every doctrine on the heart essence of the Great Perfection.<br />
And at the feet of the master Buddhaguhya.
I received myriad teachings on <em>The Secret Essence, The Net of Illusion.</em><a class="footnote" href="#fn__6" id="fnref__6" title="see footnote">[6]</a> </p>
    <p>At Śrī Siṃha’s feet I then bowed down,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__7" id="fnref__7" title="see footnote">[7]</a><br />
Receiving all the tantras of Mahottara Heruka.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__8" id="fnref__8" title="see footnote">[8]</a><br />
I went before the master Mañjuśrīmitra<br />
And received, without exception, every Mañjuśrī Yamāntaka tantra.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__9" id="fnref__9" title="see footnote">[9]</a> </p>
    <p>Then I went to Nāgarjuna, the great master,<br />
To request the tantras and sādhanas on Padma, awakened speech. <a class="footnote" href="#fn__10" id="fnref__10" title="see footnote">[10]</a><br />
I visited the great master Hūṃkāra and received <br />
All the tantras and sadhanas on Yangdak, awakened mind.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__11" id="fnref__11" title="see footnote">[11]</a> </p>
    <p>In the presence of the master Vimalamitra <br />
I received the tantras and sādhanas of Amṛta, awakened qualities. <a class="footnote" href="#fn__12" id="fnref__12" title="see footnote">[12]</a><br />
I went before the master Dhanasaṃskṛta <br />
And requested the tantras and sādhanas on Kīla, awakened activity. <a class="footnote" href="#fn__13" id="fnref__13" title="see footnote">[13]</a> </p>
    <p>Once again, I journeyed back to Prabhahasti <br />
And received from him the hundred thousand verses of the <em>Sublime Knowledge of Kīla</em> collection.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__14" id="fnref__14" title="see footnote">[14]</a><br />
At the feet of Śāntigarbha, the great master,<br />
I received the tantras and sādhanas for Jikten Chötö<a class="footnote" href="#fn__15" id="fnref__15" title="see footnote">[15]</a> and Möpa Drakngak.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__16" id="fnref__16" title="see footnote">[16]</a> </p>
    <p>Furthermore, from accomplished masters in great numbers<br />
I received a plethora of empowerments, explanations, and instructions <br />
On a plethora of tantras, statements, and sādhanas <br />
From the Tripiṭaka<a class="footnote" href="#fn__17" id="fnref__17" title="see footnote">[17]</a> and the outer and inner Secret Mantra.  </p>
    <p>
      <em>This was the second chapter in Padma’s Wish-Fulfilling Tree, my story of liberation, on how I requested key instructions from all the masters and resolved all uncertainty.</em>
    </p>
    <h3>Chapter Three</h3>
    <p><span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">ཐ་ཅ།ཐརྒྱ༔</span><br />
Then I reached perfection in my practice <br />
In India’s eight major charnel grounds and sacred places, <br />
And with diverse siddhi signs I overcame the hordes of māras. <br />
Above all, when trouble arose at the Vajra Throne of India,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__18" id="fnref__18" title="see footnote">[18]</a><br />
Caused by evil-minded teachers preaching extreme beliefs, <br />
I settled it with logic and used my power to defeat them. <br />
Five hundred paṇḍitas then placed me on a throne, <br />
And as the Buddha’s regent I preserved the doctrine for a hundred years. <br />
Later, Vimalamitra, the great paṇḍita, became my successor.  </p>
    <p>I, Guru from Uḍḍiyāna, went to the land of Zahor, <br />
Where the ruler, in his ignorance, had me burned alive. <br />
I displayed a miracle, transforming the pyre into a lake, <br />
Which set everyone in the kingdom onto the Dharma path. <br />
There I upheld the Buddha’s teachings for two hundred years.  </p>
    <p>Then I went to attain immortality in Māratika, <br />
And Lord Amitāyus appeared before my eyes, <br />
Bestowing one hundred and eight sādhanas on longevity. <br />
I then proceeded to the Akaniṣṭha Realm of Dense Array,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__19" id="fnref__19" title="see footnote">[19]</a> <br />
And to the pure realms of the five buddha families. <br />
There I requested tantras from all the sugatas <br />
And conversed with all the nirmāṇakāya buddhas, who declared: <br />
“There is no buddha apart from this: your mind!”  </p>
    <p>In the upper practice cave of Yangleshö, <a class="footnote" href="#fn__20" id="fnref__20" title="see footnote">[20]</a><br />
In order to attain the siddhi of the Great Seal, <a class="footnote" href="#fn__21" id="fnref__21" title="see footnote">[21]</a><br />
I performed the practice of glorious Yangdak Heruka. <br />
Hindrances arose, inflicting pain upon India and Nepal, <br />
So I asked my masters to send me Dharma methods to repel them. <br />
The messengers carried back the <em>Sublime Knowledge of Kīla</em>, <br />
And by its mere arrival in Nepal, all hindrances were quelled. <br />
Thus, I achieved the supreme siddhi, the Great Seal.  </p>
    <p>While I was practicing at Yari Gong, Upper Slate Mountain,<br />
Extremists stirred dissension against the Vajra Throne. <br />
Ḍākinīs appeared before a group five hundred Buddhist scholars,<br />
And told them to send a message to Sūrya Siṃha, the Indian king,<br />
And to his priests, to call me back to the Vajra Throne.<br />
There, I once again defeated all extremist teachers. </p>
    <p>With the eight great masters<a class="footnote" href="#fn__22" id="fnref__22" title="see footnote">[22]</a> I then travelled to Cool Grove cemetery,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__23" id="fnref__23" title="see footnote">[23]</a><br />
Where we remained in meditation for seven days.<br />
On the final night, at the Great Enchanting Mound Stūpa,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__24" id="fnref__24" title="see footnote">[24]</a><br />
We all beheld, as we meditated there,<br />
That the stupa was glowing, sparks of light flashing.<br />
A ḍākinī<a class="footnote" href="#fn__25" id="fnref__25" title="see footnote">[25]</a> appeared and gave us each a casket of treasure teachings.<br />
While I personally received the instructions for the <em>Assembly of Sugatas</em>,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__26" id="fnref__26" title="see footnote">[26]</a><br />
Each of the masters also received a mandate of their own.<br />
For a long time we remained at the Vajra Throne, preserving the Dharma. </p>
    <p>
      <em>This was the third chapter in Padma’s Wish-Fulfilling Tree, my story of liberation, on how I upheld the teachings in the land of India and established every country in the Dharma.</em>
    </p>
    <h3>Chapter Four</h3>
    <p><span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">ཐ་ཅ།ཐརྒྱ༔</span><br />
Then, through the force of aspirations in the past,<br />
Tri Songdetsen, who was a Dharma-upholding king,<br />
Gave rise to deep-felt wishes that a temple be built<br />
And invited the great pandita Shantarakshita to come and pacify the site. While the land was actually tamed without a problem,<br />
The paṇḍita pretended otherwise and spoke of the prophecy of my arrival.<br />
Three emissaries<a class="footnote" href="#fn__27" id="fnref__27" title="see footnote">[27]</a> were thus sent with an invitation and gold. </p>
    <p>They requested permission from the Indian king and his priests,<br />
Who discussed whether I should be allowed to go.<br />
Even though the Indian lands were under threat from extremist teachers,<br />
the predicted time had come for spreading the Dharma in Tibet.<br />
Therefore they decided that I should undertake the journey<br />
And signed the letter; the messengers were sent ahead,<br />
And I set out from India. </p>
    <p>As I approached central Nepal, the Tibetan gods and demons<br />
Grew concerned—soon all were wracked with worry.<br />
Once again, five messengers were dispatched<br />
And we met in Mangyul. These were the first Tibetans<br />
To have faith in my miraculous abilities. </p>
    <p>In Tibet, on the shore of Nyima Khü (Sun Rim Lake),<br />
I bound the yakṣas and rākṣasas under oath.<br />
I bound the Tenma Sisters on the heights of the Khala Pass,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__28" id="fnref__28" title="see footnote">[28]</a><br />

In Tsang at Oyuk, on the dreadful pass of Shang,<br />
I subdued Dorjé Lekpa,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__32" id="fnref__32" title="see footnote">[32]</a> and, in Yeru and Yönru,<br />

    <p>At Anchung Dzong Fortress the genyen spirits came to greet me,<br />

    <p>At the holy site of Buchu<a class="footnote" href="#fn__57" id="fnref__57" title="see footnote">[57]</a> I bound the minor <em>lutren</em> nāgas,<br />

And likewise, at Maldro, all the nāgas. </p>
    <p>In the southern land of Mön<a class="footnote" href="#fn__59" id="fnref__59" title="see footnote">[59]</a> I bound the <em>mudü</em> demons,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__60" id="fnref__60" title="see footnote">[60]</a><br />
And in Sikkim, Land of Crops, the <em>rongdü</em> valley demons.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__61" id="fnref__61" title="see footnote">[61]</a><br />

    <p>In the valley of Tsang, gods and humans welcomed me,<br />
And at Tölung all the Tibetans came to welcome me too.<br />
There, at Dongwa,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__64" id="fnref__64" title="see footnote">[64]</a> I caused a spring of siddhi nectar to gush forth. </p>
    <p>At Drakmar’s Tamarisk Grove, the king came forth to greet me.<br />
Although he was emperor, an emanation of Mañjushri,<br />
The veil of his human birth was extremely dense,<br />
And so he failed to see my qualities in full. </p>
    <p>High and mighty, full of pride, the king’s attitude was offensive.<br />
So I sang a song of my greatness and displayed my magic.<br />
The emperor’s faith was kindled; he bowed down low<br />
And presented a throne of gold and gifts in great abundance.<br />
All Tibet’s gods and humans then came to pay their respects. </p>
    <p>
      <em>This was the fourth chapter in Padma’s Wish-Fulfilling Tree, my story of liberation, on how the monarch of Tibet invited me to his land and how the gods and demons were subdued.</em>
    </p>
    <h3>Chapter Five</h3>
    <p><span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">ཐ་ཅ།ཐརྒྱ༔</span><br />
Then I summoned every god and demon in the kingdom of Tibet,<br />
Gave them orders, bound them to oaths, and consecrated the land.<br />
With vajra dance and song of <em>hūṃ</em>, they were brought under my command.<br />
During the day, the people laid down Samye’s foundations,<br />
But it was the gods and demons who took up the work at night. </p>
    <p>The Four Great Kings<a class="footnote" href="#fn__65" id="fnref__65" title="see footnote">[65]</a> assisted, supervising their work;<br />
And as the walls went up with joyful, clamorous song,<br />
Gods and demons raised them even higher at night than humans by day! </p>
    <p>Meanwhile, between the king and nāgas a covenant was made,<br />
And the nāgas were assigned to fill the land with golden dust.<br />
Samye was constructed in differing designs—<br />
The central temple with three stories was built like Mount Meru,<br />
The two yakṣa temples like the sun and moon,<br />
And the whole was ornamented with the four continents and eight minor isles.<br />
One hundred and eight stūpas placed upon the Iron Mountain wall,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__66" id="fnref__66" title="see footnote">[66]</a><br />
And four female dogs of copper were set upon four stone pillars. </p>
    <p>The three stories were made in the styles of India, China and Tibet.<br />
Samantabhadra was the central figure in the upper storey,<br />
With the maṇḍala of <em>Vairocana’s Awakening</em>.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__67" id="fnref__67" title="see footnote">[67]</a><br />
In the middle storey, the chief figure was Vairocana,<br />
Surrounded by the deities of the <em>Vajra Space Maṇḍala</em>.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__68" id="fnref__68" title="see footnote">[68]</a><br />
Central on the ground floor was the Great Awakened One,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__69" id="fnref__69" title="see footnote">[69]</a><br />
With all the buddhas of the ten directions and their closest heirs. </p>
    <p>All the temples were consecrated, flower petals strewn,<br />
And wisdom deities descended into every statue, for all to see.<br />
Rays of light blazed forth and the sound of music was heard.<br />
The gods all showered down a rain of flowers<br />
And the nāgas came to offer gifts of precious gems;<br />
Thus the world was filled with auspiciousness of every kind. </p>
    <p>Male and female protectors arrived to flank the temple’s sides.<br />
The stone pillars shot forth flames, and the dogs growled and barked.<br />
Three times <em>arura</em> fruits<a class="footnote" href="#fn__70" id="fnref__70" title="see footnote">[70]</a> were showered down like rain.<br />
Over all Tibet, auspicious signs and goodness reigned.<br />
Both gods and men were filled with joy, again and yet again—<br />
And so the banner of fame was unfurled across the land. </p>
    <p>
      <em>This was the fifth chapter in Padma’s Wish-Fulfilling Tree, my story of liberation, on how I built the monastery of Samyé and performed its consecration.</em>
    </p>
    <h3>Chapter Six</h3>
    <p><span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">ཐ་ཅ།ཐརྒྱ༔</span><br />
Then, we, Abbot and Master,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__71" id="fnref__71" title="see footnote">[71]</a> conferred together:<br />
“This kingdom of Tibet is a land of savages.<br />
They don’t know good from evil, so how can Dharma’s truth be taught?<br />
Tibetan ministers are all puffed up with jealousy.<br />
So, once the king’s wishes are fulfilled, let’s go back to our own lands.” </p>
    <p>The emperor caught wind of our discussion,<br />
And he grew deeply saddened, shedding many tears.<br />
Yet again, he presented us with a priceless gold mandala. </p>
    <p>“Masters, out of your deepest kindness, hear me!<br />
My wishes as king, Tri Songdetsen, are indeed lofty,<br />
For this land of Tibet is savage, shrouded in darkness,<br />
And not a single word of the Dharma here resounds.<br />
Masters, perhaps you’re disappointed, but look upon us with love:<br />
I beg you, please, care for us with your awakened compassion! </p>
    <p>“As enlightened emanations you entered this wretched land,<br />
And as bodhisattvas, your work is to care for others.<br />
You have no other task than to fulfill the needs of beings.<br />
I, Tri Songdetsen, beseech you—please fulfill my prayers! </p>
    <p>“I have built shrines for the awakened body, speech, and mind,<br />
For I wish to bring the Dharma of Sutra and Tantra to Tibet,<br />
And propagate it through study, practice and meditation.<br />
So, masters, please ensure that this takes place!<br />
Abbot, Master, I beseech you both—don’t leave, but stay here, in Tibet!” </p>
    <p>We, Master and Abbot, conferred, and decided to remain.<br />
I prophesied the Tibetan children of exceptional potential;<br />
They were gathered, and we taught them the art of translation.<br />
From among this multitude, one hundred <em>lotsāwas</em><a class="footnote" href="#fn__72" id="fnref__72" title="see footnote">[72]</a> emerged,<br />
Including Ka, Chok and Zhang<a class="footnote" href="#fn__73" id="fnref__73" title="see footnote">[73]</a> and, foremost of all, Vairocana.<br />
I myself led the translation of the outer and inner tantras,<br />
While the Abbot was in charge of all aspects of Sūtra and Vinaya. </p>
    <p>Since the basis for the Dharma is the precious Sangha,<br />
Eleven hundred Tibetan youngsters then took the vows of monks.<br />
We taught them the names of each and every Indian master,<br />
And sent a hundred lotsāwas off to the land of India. </p>
    <p>One hundred great paṇḍitas were invited to Tibet—<br />
Vimalamitra, Buddhaguhya, and others of their kind.<br />
And so, in the temple—paṇḍitas, lotsāwas, Abbot and Master—we took our seats<br />
Upon beautiful and lofty thrones, all wrapped in rich brocade,<br />
And we were served the finest treats and offered maṇḍalas of gold. </p>
    <p>The teachings of sūtra and tantra we translated in their entirety.<br />
The three collections of vinaya, sūtra and abhidharma,<br />
The <em>pāramitā</em><a class="footnote" href="#fn__74" id="fnref__74" title="see footnote">[74]</a> in its longer, medium and shorter forms—<br />
Thus, all the sūtra teachings, without exception, we translated.<br />
The definitive teachings, such as the <em>Mahāparinirvāṇa sūtra</em>—<a class="footnote" href="#fn__75" id="fnref__75" title="see footnote">[75]</a><br />
All of them, without exception, likewise we translated. </p>
    <p>Kriyā and Yoga tantras such as the <em>Vajra Summit</em>—<a class="footnote" href="#fn__76" id="fnref__76" title="see footnote">[76]</a><br />
All the outer tantras, without exception, we translated.<br />
The eight tantras of <em>The Net of Illusion</em>, including <em>The Secret Essence</em>,<br /><em>The Scripture of Assembly</em> transmissions, the Mind Section cycles,<br /><em>The Eight Sādhana Teachings'</em> five root<br />
And ten specific tantras, fifteen in all—<br />
Untold number of Secret Mantra’s inner tantras we translated. </p>
    <p>Moreover, countless teachings of sūtra and tantra<br />
Were, day and night, translated, studied, and explained.<br />
Throughout the Tibetan kingdom we established Dharma schools<br />
And compiled myriad volumes of sūtras and tantras. </p>
    <p>With parasols and banners, pennants and streamers,<br />
With articles of offering, countless in number,<br />
All so very beautiful and resplendently arranged,<br />
The volumes were carried upon the monks’ shoulders,<br />
And in between were carried all kinds of offerings. </p>
    <p>The panditas and lotsāwas were seated in horse-drawn chariots,<br />
With parasols above and banners at their flanks.<br />
Untold numbers of instruments filled the air with music<br />
As they circled the temples, led always by fragrant incense.<br />
This was the day when Namkhé Nyingpo displayed miracles<br />
And all the scriptures were ceremoniously installed in the middle storey.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__77" id="fnref__77" title="see footnote">[77]</a> </p>
    <p>Then thrones were erected upon Yobok Meadow<br />
And all were offered a golden mandala and a brick of gold,<br />
A set of garments each, and a roll of silk and wool,<br />
A horse, a mule, and a male and female dzo,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__78" id="fnref__78" title="see footnote">[78]</a><br />
A lamb’s wool coat, a woolen jacket, leather case, and block of tea,<br />
A hundred coins of gold apiece, and a thousand pieces of silver. </p>
    <p>Once these were offered, the king rose from his seat.<br />
He spoke about his royal lineage, Tibetan customs, and his vision,<br />
And he extolled the virtues and kindness of the paṇḍitas and lotsāwas.<br />
Then Vimalamitra spoke, and other great paṇḍitas,<br />
On the origins of the Dharma and the reasons for its greatness. </p>
    <p>Next, Vairocana spoke, and the other lotsāwas,<br />
About the great paṇḍitas’ virtues and the translation of the Dharma.<br />
Gö and other ministers distributed gifts,<br />
And spoke of the ways in which their wishes had been fulfilled.<br />
All the citizens, in turn, created merit, each according to their means. </p>
    <p>Then the great paṇḍitas, each escorted by their lotsāwa,<br />
Embarked upon their journeys back to their own lands.<br />
Like the rising sun, the Dharma now shone upon Tibet. </p>
    <p>
      <em>This was the sixth chapter in Padma’s Wish-Fulfilling Tree, my story of liberation, on how paṇḍitas and lotsāwas were invited to translate the sūtra and Tantra teachings.</em>
    </p>
    <h3>Chapter Seven</h3>
    <p><span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">ཐ་ཅ།ཐརྒྱ༔</span><br />
When I, the Lotus Master, was engaged in sādhana practice<br />
At the secluded hermitage of Samyé Chimpu,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__79" id="fnref__79" title="see footnote">[79]</a><br />
King Tri Songdetsen, as the monarch of Tibet—<br />
Accompanied by Namkhé Nyingpo and Sangyé Yeshé,<br />
Gyalwang Chöyang and Lady Yeshé Tsogyal,<br />
Palkyi Wangchuk and Dorjé Düdjom,<br />
And Vairocana and the other royal subjects—<br />
Came with maṇḍalas of gold, and requested repeatedly<br />
That I reveal the maṇḍala of <em>The Assembly of Sugatas</em>. </p>
    <p>I revealed the mandala to the king and subjects<br />
And conferred the <em>Assembly</em>’s grand empowerment on them.<br />
This was when the monarch’s flower fell upon Mahottara,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__80" id="fnref__80" title="see footnote">[80]</a><br />
Namkhé Nyingpo’s flower fell on Yangdak Heruka,<br />
Sangyé Yeshé’s flower fell on Yamantaka.<br />
Gyalwang Choyang’s flower fell on Hayagriva,<br />
Yeshé Tsogyal’s flower fell on Kila,<br />
Palkyi Wangchuk’s flower fell on Mamo,<br />
Dorjé Düdjom’s flower fell on Jikten Chötö,<br />
and Vairocana’s flower fell on Möpa Drakngak.<br />
And so they practiced, each within their destined maṇḍala.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__81" id="fnref__81" title="see footnote">[81]</a> </p>
    <p>King and disciples all brought forth signs of accomplishment:<br />
Tri Songdetsen overpowered the others’ experience with his splendour;<br />
Namkhé Nyingpo rode on the sun’s rays, as though astride a horse;<br />
Sangyé Yeshé plunged his dagger into solid rock;<br />
Gyalwang Chöyang sent forth horse neighs from his crown;<br />
Yeshé Tsogyal could revive human corpses;<br />
Palkyi Wangchuk caused paralysis by pointing his dagger;<br />
Dorjé Düdjom moved about freely, swift as the wind;<br />
And Vairocana employed the spirits as his servants.<br />
Indeed, many more siddhis, too, were displayed by King and disciples. </p>
    <p>I gave the ripening empowerments and liberating instructions<br />
For the myriad maṇḍalas of <em>The Embodiment of the Gurus’ Realization</em>,
<em>The Embodiment of the Yidams’ Realization</em>, <em>The Embodiment of the Ḍākinīs’ Realization</em>,<br />
And <em>The Embodiment of the Protectors’ Realization</em>.<br />
Thus, I spread the practices intended for the retreat centers of Tibet. </p>
    <p>
      <em>This was the seventh chapter in Padma’s Wish-Fulfilling Tree, my story of liberation, on how I gave the ripening empowerments, and how the king and disciples showed the signs of accomplishment.</em>
    </p>
    <h3>Chapter Eight</h3>
    <p><span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">ཐ་ཅ།ཐརྒྱ༔</span><br />
It was then that I, the Lotus Master reflected:<br />
“Here in Tibet, all the teachings of Sūtra and Tantra,<br />
And of the outer, inner, and innermost Vajrayana,<br />
Have been studied, contemplated, and practiced, and siddhi signs achieved.<br />
Yet the essence of them all, an indispensable teaching—<br />
The <em>Ocean of Dharma, the Gathering of Transmitted Precepts</em><a class="footnote" href="#fn__82" id="fnref__82" title="see footnote">[82]</a>—<br />
I must now with care bestow upon the king and disciples.”<br />
At that very same moment, the king and the three princes<br />
Requested me to give it, in Chimphu Cave, in the expanded way. </p>
    <p>Later, while I was concealing many treasures of awakened mind,<br />
The Tibetan emperor, King Tri Songdetsen,<br />
With Muné Tsenpo, the senior prince,<br />
And Murup Tsenpo, the second prince,<br />
And Mutik Tsenpo, the youngest prince,<br />
Along with Gyalwang Chöyang, the lotsāwa of Langdro,<br />
The great Jñānakumāra of Nyak, and others,<br />
With Vairocana and Palkyi Sengé of Shübu,<br />
With Tingdzin Zangpo and Dorjé Düdjom,<br />
Palkyi Wangchuk and Wangchuk of Odren,<br />
With Atsara Salé and Dorjé Tsomo of Shelkar,<br />
With Drokpen lotsāwa, and Tsogyal with her three servants,<br />
And the three brides of the three princes, among so many others—<br />
All came, each with their following, to Namkha Dzong in Kham. </p>
    <p>After unveiling the <em>Ocean of Dharma, the Gathering of Transmitted Precepts</em>,<br />
I gave the king and disciples the ripening empowerments<br />
And thoroughly explained the essential liberating instructions.<br />
After practicing this one-pointedly for seven years, with his retinue,<br />
The king could freely move through rocks and mountain.<br />
Muné Tsenpo beheld the deity in person,<br />
Murup Tsenpo gained the wakefulness of greatest bliss,<br />
Mutri Tsenpo saw the very essence of his mind,<br />
Vairocana soared like a bird into the sky,<br />
Gyalwang Chöyang transformed his body into a bonfire,<br />
Könchok of Langdro’s form became a fiery mass of light,<br />
Sangyé Yeshé arrived at the stage of Universal Light,<br />
The great Jñana of Nyak realized the exhaustion of phenomena,<br />
Kharchen Tsogyal drew immortal nectar out of solid rock,<br />
Atsara Salé shattered boulders with bare hand,<br />
Drokmi Palkyi Yeshé’s gaze burned down forests,<br />
Dorjé Düdjom’s gaze evaporated an entire lake,<br />
Tingdzin Zangpo pierced straight into a mountain wall,<br />
Lady Shelkar<a class="footnote" href="#fn__83" id="fnref__83" title="see footnote">[83]</a> used the mamo spirits as her servants.<br />
Many were the siddhi signs displayed by the disciples. </p>
    <p>All the scriptures were then written down in magical letters<br />
And concealed as treasures at seven supreme sites.<br />
Moreover, I predicted those who would reveal them,<br />
Sealed them with commands, aspirations, and conferred empowerments.<br />
In the Age of Strife, when the lifespan is but thirty years,<br />
These treasures will appear; such is my prediction, my samaya! </p>
    <p><em>This was the eighth chapter in Padma’s Wish-Fulfilling Tree, my story of liberation, on how I revealed the Ocean of Dharma, the Gathering of Transmitted Precepts and concealed it as treasure.</em> </p>
    <h3>Chapter Nine</h3>
    <p><span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">ཐ་ཅ།ཐརྒྱ༔</span><br />
After this, I wrote down all the profound Dharma teachings<br />
In five kinds of writing upon scrolls of five kinds of material,<br />
And inserted it in caskets, extraordinary and wondrous.<br />
In Lhasa, and in Samye, Yoru, and Tramdruk,<br />
At the Border Taming and Further Taming Temples,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__84" id="fnref__84" title="see footnote">[84]</a><br />
At the Sheldrak Cave of Yarlung and the Lhodrak Cliff of Kharchu,<br />
At the Yangdzong Fortress of Drak, and in Dawaphuk Cave at Yerpa,<br />
In Yamalung Valley, and Zabu Valley in Tsang,<br />
At Mount Trapzang and at Riwoché in Tsang,<br />
On Lapchi’s snowy range and Yolmo’s snowy ridge,<br />
At Namkechen and the eight sites of Bhutan,<br />
At Tsari Gyala and the holy site of Sengdam Buwo,<br />
At the extraordinary Drakar Cliff of Tidro,<br />
And at the twenty-five sacred places of Upper and Lower Kham—<br />
Five for awakened form, five for speech, and five for awakened mind,<br />
Five for qualities and five for the awakened activities—<br />
At all these places I practiced, consecrating the sites,<br />
And concealing countless treasures there, both major and minor. </p>
    <p>Even though the teachings now shine like the light of the sun,<br />
Within three generations of the present king’s descendants<br />
There will appear a king with ox-shaped head and malicious plans.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__85" id="fnref__85" title="see footnote">[85]</a><br />
That is when, due to an obstructing minister with raven-like head,<br />
The Buddha’s teachings will be torn to the ground. </p>
    <p>Following this, the royals and disciples now present<br />
Will reappear in the future, due to their noble aspirations,<br />
As two supreme treasure-revealers,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__86" id="fnref__86" title="see footnote">[86]</a> twenty Lingpas,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__87" id="fnref__87" title="see footnote">[87]</a> twenty lingpas,<br />
Another hundred tertöns, lords of the teachings,<br />
And a further retinue of a thousand and two minor tertöns.<br />
Moreover, re-concealed termas will be countless in number. </p>
    <p>The propagators of these teachings, doctrine-holding masters,<br />
Will appear by the hundreds, accompanying each great tertön.<br />
Each area will have its own treasure revealer,<br />
And each place of my sadhana practice will have a treasure site. </p>
    <p>In each district there will appear a siddha of renown,<br />
And every town will have a venerable master.<br />
There will be a monk for every householder, worthy of offerings, And a mantrika to subdue their hindrances and threats.<br />
Thus, in the future, the teachings will fill every corner of the land.<br />
All of this shall be the work of my awakened emanations.<br />
So bring forth pure perception, future people of Tibet! </p>
    <p>
      <em>This was the ninth chapter in Padma’s Wish-Fulfilling Tree, my story of liberation, on how I concealed the treasures and predicted their revealers.</em>
    </p>
    <h3>Chapter Ten</h3>
    <p><span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">ཐ་ཅ།ཐརྒྱ༔</span><br />
Then I declared, “Our teacher Śākyamuni Buddha,<br />
In <em>The Sūtra of Predictions in Magadha</em>, spoke these words:<br />
'The rākṣasas will pour out from the lands of the southwest;<br />
They will invade and obliterate this Jambu continent.’<br />
My time among the Tibetans, in this embodied form, is now complete,<br />
So I must head southwest now, to tame the rākṣasa demons. </p>
    <p>When the prince<a class="footnote" href="#fn__88" id="fnref__88" title="see footnote">[88]</a> heard these words,<br />
He cried out, deeply saddened,<br />
And tried to dissuade me from departing.<br />
Out of kindness then, and to benefit the Tibetan people,<br />
I predicted representations of my body, hid treasures to represent my speech,<br />
And entrusted my heart-realization to predestined heirs.<br />
As I explained this point, the prince’s sadness disappeared,<br />
And so again I made ready to set off for the land of the rākṣasas. </p>
    <p>Everyone escorted me to the mountain pass of Mangyul,<br />
Where I gave my final testament to the prince and Tibetan people,<br />
Along with thirteen pith instructions for clearing away obstacles<br />
And protect your descendants, in the form of a prayer,<a class="footnote" href="#fn__89" id="fnref__89" title="see footnote">[89]</a><br />
And the inner sādhana with its many applications.<a class="footnote" href="#fn__90" id="fnref__90" title="see footnote">[90]</a><br />
These were concealed at Khala Rongo in Mangyul. </p>
    <p>All those in the future who could not meet me in person,<br />
Should study and recite this, my story of liberation.<br />
Memorize it to perfection and understand it to its depths!<br />
When you read this biography during your six sessions,<br />
Bring me to mind, then call upon me in this way:<a class="footnote" href="#fn__91" id="fnref__91" title="see footnote">[91]</a> </p>
    <p>“Emaho! Dharmakāya Samantabhadra and Vajradhara, the Sixth,<br />
Vajrasattva, our teacher, and the blessed King of Śākyas,<br />
Lord of Boundless Life, Amitāyus, and All-Seeing Avalokiteśvara—<br />
To you, Padma, who is inseparable from them all, we pray!<br />
In essence, your awakened body is Mañjuśrī Yamāntaka;<br />
In essence, your awakened speech is mighty Hayagrīva;<br />
And, in essence, your awakened mind is Yangdak Heruka—<br />
To you, our Wish-Fulfilling Guru, we pray!<br />
Your overwhelming qualities are Mahottara Heruka;<br />
Your awakened activity Vajrakumāra, in essence;<br />
And you rule over the mamos and ḍākinīs as Ngöndzok Gyalpo—<br />
To you, Supremely Glorious Tötreng Tsal, we pray!<br />
Your form encompasses the illusory net of peaceful and wrathful deities,<br />
The melody of your speech holds the twelve special qualities,<br />
And your unimpeded wisdom pervades everywhere—<br />
To you, Overlord of the Ḍākinīs, we pray!<br />
You foretold representatives of your body, hid treasures for your speech,<br />
You entrusted your heart-realization to destined heirs,<br />
And you left your loving testament for all the Tibetan people—<br />
To you, the kindest of awakened emanations, we pray!<br />
We recall your overwhelming kindness, Guru Rinpoché—<br />
Please remember your promise to hold us in your embrace,<br />
For in these troubled times we have no hope but you.<br />
Look upon us with compassion, awakened emanation of Uḍḍīyana!<br />
With your power and strength, dispel the turbulence of this dark age,<br />
Bestow your blessings and the great empowerment of wisdom,<br />
Increase the strength of our experience and realization,<br />
Grant us powerful skills to benefit the teachings and beings,<br />
And bring us, we pray, to buddhahood in this very life!” </p>
    <p>After instructing them to call upon me in this way, I mounted a fine horse held aloft by four ḍākinīs.<br />
“Once every month I shall return for the sake of the Tibetans. In particular, on the tenth day of the Monkey month, I will come to clear away the troubles of all Tibetans. Call upon me, don’t forget!” Then I turned my gaze directly to the southwest and took my leave. The prince and the other Tibetan disciples returned to their homes, where they each continued with their own practice. </p>
    <p>
      <em>This was the tenth chapter in Padma’s Wish-Fulfilling Tree, my story of liberation, on how I gave my testament and then departed to subjugate the rākṣasas in the southwest.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="TibetanInlineEnglish">ཐ་ཅ།ཐརྒྱ༔</span>
      <br />
      <em>I, Tsogyal, later wrote down this biography and concealed it as a treasure.
May it meet with the worthy one endowed with the right karma.
Having met with him, may its benefit for beings be boundless.
Samaya, seal, seal, seal.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>I, Orgyen Chokgyur Lingpa, one of the great incarnated revealers of treasure, brought this forth from Akaniṣṭha Karma’s Damchen Drak Cliff.</em>
